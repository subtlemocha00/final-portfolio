							<p class="companyText">
								Beer? Beer good! Beer wets mouth. Less thirsty humans make nicer
								friends. Having friends who are more content leads to improved
								conversation and an opportunity to expand one's vocabulary.
								Fulminate against mediocrity! Insist on the finer things in life
								and demand nothing less. As famed author Mark Twain once noted,
								"Beer good!"
								<br /><br />
								As most university students will tell you, beer is the whole
								package. It quenches your thirst, you look cool holding it, it
								smells of heaven and it makes socializing much more bearable. At
								least, that's what Ezekiel - our head brewer and the creator of
								our great company - thinks of this bubbly refreshment. Dreams of
								beer led Zeke on a mission to make his own. That and a strong
								desire to drink and provide booze to his friends for next to no
								cost.
								<br /><br />
								It all started with a large pot on the stove and a lonely carboy
								fermenting in the closet. This first batch was certainly
								passable but wouldn't hold up to Zeke's high standards of taste,
								mouthfeel and fragrance. He experimented for months until
								settling on a unique take on a classic ale. He knew it was good
								because all of his friends couldn't stop drinking it and they
								were soon offering money in exchange for an ice cold taste of
								his homebrew. Being an unlicensed merchant of alcoholic
								beverages is not strictly legal so Zeke decided on a workaround.
								<br /><br />
								Ezekiel prepositioned his comrades with an idea that could allow
								him to continue persuing his passion of brewing and would
								provide endless amounts of suds for them. It was time to start a
								brewery! That lonely carboy quickly gained some companions and
								soon they evolved to become full-sized commercial fermenters,
								arranged neatly in rows, housed inside a giant warehouse. From
								here, it was only a short time until people all over the country
								could enjoy Zeke's fine concoctions under the brand name Aesop's
								Ales. <br /><br />
								Come in today to get your mitts on the legends!
